[Verse 1]
I've been tryin' to change (Oh)
Tryin' to find somebody to love me, oh no
But I end up in the same damn place again
Hopin' I could be different, but I'd be playin' pretend
I wish that I was perfect (Just like you)
But I'm an alien, oh no
I'm sending out an SOS, take me home
We're not meant to be together, no

[Chorus]
What if I said I'm tryin'
To save your love from dyin'?
Baby, I'm too far gone (Oh)
Don't wanna see you cryin'
But I just know who I am
And maybe that's the hardest part, oh
Baby, you can't fix me
I was born with a broken heart

[Verse 2]
If I was a cactus (Oh)
You would be a balloon, oh no
I wanna feel the same as humans do
I wanna feel the same as you, but I don't


[Chorus]
Oh, what if I said I'm tryin'
To save your love from dyin'?
Baby, I'm too far gone (Oh)
Don't wanna see you cryin'
But I just know who I am
And maybe that's the hardest part, oh
Baby, you can't fix me
I was born with a broken heart

[Bridge]
Oh
I'm sorry
That I'm leavin'
Oh, oh
I'm sorry
We're just different
But, baby, you can't fix me

[Chorus]
What if I said I'm tryin'
To save your love from dyin'?
Baby, I'm too far gone (Oh)
Don't wanna see you cryin'
But I just know who I am
And maybe that's the hardest part, oh
Baby, you can't fix me (Oh)
Baby, you can't fix me, oh
Baby, you can't fix me
I was born with a broken heart
